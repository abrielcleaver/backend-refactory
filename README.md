# Abriel's Refactory

### Description

ACME Widgets Factory, Inc. needs help cleaning up the implementation of their order tracking API. They have some big plans for the future of this API, but need to address some lingering tech debt issues before new features can be added.

My task was to refactor the `orders` controller by extracting any database-related functionality into the corresponding `Order` model. I then refactored the existing tests to use my `Order` model.
